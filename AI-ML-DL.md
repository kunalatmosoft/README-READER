### Definition:
ML is a subset of AI that enables machines to improve at tasks with experience (data). It uses algorithms to analyze data, learn from it, and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for each specific task.

### Types of Machine Learning:
1. **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled data. A model is trained to map inputs to outputs, i.e., for each input (features), the corresponding output (label) is known.
   - **Example**: Spam detection in emails (classification), predicting house prices (regression).
   
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm works on unlabeled data, identifying hidden patterns without explicit output labels.
   - **Example**: Market segmentation (clustering), anomaly detection.

3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: This combines both labeled and unlabeled data, improving the learning accuracy by using the small amount of labeled data to guide the model.
   - **Example**: Image classification with partially labeled images.

4. **Reinforcement Learning**: An agent learns by interacting with the environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments.
   - **Example**: Game playing (like AlphaGo) and robotics.

### Key ML Terminologies:
- **Training Data**: The data used to train a machine learning model.
- **Model**: A mathematical representation of a machine learning algorithm trained on data.
- **Features**: The attributes or independent variables used as inputs for the model.
- **Target Variable**: The output or dependent variable the model is predicting in supervised learning.
- **Loss Function**: A function that calculates the difference between predicted and actual outcomes, used to adjust model parameters.
- **Overfitting**: When the model fits the training data too well, capturing noise and failing to generalize to unseen data.
- **Underfitting**: When the model is too simple, failing to capture the data’s patterns.
- **Cross-Validation**: A method to assess the generalization ability of the model by training and testing on different subsets of data.
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: A balance between a model’s ability to capture data complexity (low bias) and generalize to new data (low variance).

### Common Machine Learning Algorithms:
- **Linear Regression**: Used for predicting continuous values.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification.
- **Decision Trees**: Non-linear models that split data into branches based on feature values.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees.
