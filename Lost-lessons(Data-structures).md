Elementary data organizations refer to the basic ways in which data is structured and organized in computer science to facilitate storage, access, and manipulation. These fundamental structures are the building blocks of more complex data structures and algorithms. Here are the primary elementary data organizations:

### 1. **Primitive Data Types**
These are the most basic data types supported by a programming language. They represent simple values and are used to create more complex structures.

- **Examples:**
  - **Integer:** Represents whole numbers (e.g., 1, -42, 100).
  - **Floating-point:** Represents decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.01).
  - **Character:** Represents a single character (e.g., 'a', 'B', '@').
  - **Boolean:** Represents two values: `true` or `false`.
  - **String (may be a built-in or user-defined primitive):** Represents sequences of characters (e.g., "hello").

### 2. **Arrays**
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. It allows for indexing, which enables random access to any element using an index.

- **Properties:**
  - Fixed size: The size of an array is defined at the time of creation and cannot be changed.
  - Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
  - Indexing allows O(1) access to elements.
  
- **Example:**
  ```c
  int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
  ```

### 3. **Structures (or Records)**
A structure (also called a record in some contexts) is a collection of variables of different data types, grouped together under one name. Structures allow for more complex data modeling compared to arrays, which can only store elements of the same type.

- **Properties:**
  - Can contain different data types (integers, floats, arrays, etc.).
  - Used to represent entities like a "student" or "employee" with multiple attributes.
  
- **Example:**
  ```c
  struct Student {
      int id;
      char name[50];
      float GPA;
  };
  ```

### 4. **Pointers**
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers allow for dynamic memory allocation and are critical for the implementation of more advanced data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs.

- **Properties:**
  - Can point to any data type (int, char, float, etc.).
  - Allow indirect access to variables, enabling efficient manipulation of data in memory.
  
- **Example:**
  ```c
  int x = 10;
  int *ptr = &x;  // Pointer to the memory address of x
  ```

### 5. **Linked Lists**
A linked list is a linear collection of elements, called nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed.

- **Types of Linked Lists:**
  - **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node.
  - **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points to both the previous and the next node.
  - **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  struct Node {
      int data;
      struct Node* next;
  };
  ```

### 6. **Stacks**
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are used in function call management, expression evaluation, and more.

- **Operations:**
  - **Push:** Add an element to the top of the stack.
  - **Pop:** Remove the element from the top.
  - **Peek:** View the top element without removing it.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  struct Stack {
      int top;
      int arr[100];  // Stack with max size 100
  };
  ```

### 7. **Queues**
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. Elements are added at the rear (enqueue) and removed from the front (dequeue). Queues are used in task scheduling, buffering, and breadth-first search.

- **Types of Queues:**
  - **Simple Queue:** Basic FIFO structure.
  - **Circular Queue:** The rear of the queue wraps around to the front to form a circle.
  - **Priority Queue:** Elements are dequeued based on priority, not just order of arrival.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  struct Queue {
      int front, rear;
      int arr[100];
  };
  ```

### 8. **Strings**
Strings are sequences of characters. In some programming languages, they are treated as arrays of characters, while in others, they are abstracted into a dedicated data type.

- **Example:**  
  In C, a string is typically an array of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`).
  ```c
  char str[] = "Hello, World!";
  ```

### 9. **Hash Tables**
A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets, from which the desired value can be found. Hash tables are used for fast lookup, insertion, and deletion.

- **Properties:**
  - Average time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion is O(1).
  - Uses techniques like chaining or open addressing to handle collisions.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  int hash_function(int key) {
      return key % SIZE;
  }
  ```

### 10. **Bit Fields**
Bit fields allow the storage of data in a more compact form by allocating a specific number of bits for each value. They are particularly useful in low-level programming and embedded systems where memory efficiency is critical.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  struct {
      unsigned int a: 3;
      unsigned int b: 4;
  } bitField;
  ```
