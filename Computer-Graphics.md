Computer Graphics is the branch of computer science focused on generating and manipulating visual content, such as images, animations, and 3D models. It has applications in areas like video games, virtual reality, scientific visualization, movies, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Below is an overview of the core concepts, terminologies, and tools used in computer graphics:

---

### **1. Pixels and Resolution**

- **Pixel (Picture Element)**: The smallest unit of a digital image or display that can be individually controlled. Each pixel has a color, typically represented by red, green, and blue (RGB) values.
  
- **Resolution**: The number of pixels in an image or display. Higher resolution means more pixels and typically better image quality. It’s often represented as width × height (e.g., 1920×1080, which is Full HD).

---

### **2. 2D Graphics**

- **Raster Graphics**: Images composed of a grid of pixels, where each pixel has a defined color. Raster images (or bitmaps) can lose quality when resized. Formats include PNG, JPEG, and BMP.

- **Vector Graphics**: Graphics made up of mathematical shapes (points, lines, curves, and polygons) that can scale without losing quality. Popular formats include SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and PDF.

- **Aliasing**: The visual distortion (often seen as jagged edges) that occurs when a high-resolution image is represented on a low-resolution screen.

- **Anti-aliasing**: A technique used to reduce jagged edges in raster graphics, smoothing the appearance of curves and lines.

---

### **3. 3D Graphics**

- **Vertices**: Points in 3D space used to define the shape of 3D models. A vertex has x, y, and z coordinates.

- **Edges and Faces**: 
  - **Edge**: A straight line connecting two vertices.
  - **Face**: The flat surface enclosed by edges (typically triangles or quadrilaterals in 3D models).

- **Meshes**: A collection of vertices, edges, and faces that define the shape of a 3D object. Meshes are the basic building blocks of 3D models.

- **Textures**: 2D images applied to the surface of a 3D model to give it color, detail, and realism.

- **Shading**: The process of determining how light interacts with surfaces. It affects the brightness, color, and texture of an object.

- **Lighting Models**:
  - **Diffuse Lighting**: Simulates light scattering equally in all directions, giving surfaces a soft, matte appearance.
  - **Specular Lighting**: Simulates light reflection in a specific direction, creating shiny, reflective highlights.

- **Rendering**: The process of converting 3D models into 2D images or animations. Rendering involves calculations to determine how light, shadow, and textures affect the final image.

### **4. Coordinate Systems and Transformations**

- **World Space**: The global coordinate system in which objects are positioned in 3D space.

- **Local Space/Object Space**: A coordinate system local to each object, which can be transformed (e.g., rotated, scaled) relative to the world space.

- **Transformations**:
  - **Translation**: Moving an object from one position to another in 2D or 3D space.
  - **Rotation**: Rotating an object around a specific axis or point.
  - **Scaling**: Changing the size of an object in relation to its original dimensions.

- **Projection**: The process of mapping 3D points to 2D space. Two common types of projections are:
  - **Perspective Projection**: Objects farther from the camera appear smaller, simulating the way the human eye sees.
  - **Orthographic Projection**: Objects remain the same size regardless of their distance from the camera, often used in technical drawings.

---

### **5. Animation**

- **Keyframes**: In animation, keyframes represent significant moments (or positions) of an object at certain points in time. The computer interpolates the movement or transformation between keyframes.

- **Interpolation**: The process of generating intermediate frames between two keyframes, creating the illusion of movement or transformation.

- **Rigging**: The process of creating a skeleton or structure (bones and joints) for a 3D model that allows it to be animated. Often used for characters in games and films.

- **Skinning**: Associating a 3D mesh with a rig, so when the bones of the rig move, the mesh deforms accordingly (e.g., a character bending its arm).

---

### **6. Rendering Techniques**

- **Ray Tracing**: A rendering technique that simulates the way light rays interact with objects to produce highly realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections. It traces the path of light from the camera through each pixel.

- **Rasterization**: A more common and faster rendering technique used in real-time applications like video games. It converts 3D models into 2D images by calculating the color and shading of each pixel.

- **Global Illumination**: A method of rendering that simulates indirect lighting (light bouncing off surfaces) for more realistic lighting effects.

- **Shaders**: Small programs that run on the GPU and control how surfaces appear in the rendered scene. Common shader types include:
  - **Vertex Shaders**: Control the position and transformation of vertices.
  - **Fragment/Pixel Shaders**: Control the color, lighting, and texture effects of each pixel.

---

### **7. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)**

- **GPU**: A specialized hardware device designed for rendering images and performing complex calculations for computer graphics and machine learning tasks. GPUs are highly parallel processors that handle many tasks simultaneously.

- **Shaders**: Programs written to run on the GPU to control rendering tasks like color blending, lighting, and transformations.

---

### **8. Framebuffer and Double Buffering**

- **Framebuffer**: A portion of memory in the GPU where the image that will be displayed on the screen is stored.

- **Double Buffering**: A technique used to prevent flickering in animations by rendering images to an off-screen buffer first, and then copying the final image to the display in a single operation.
